       <h1>"Why Would You Move to Saint Louis?"</h1>
       <p>
           I was asked this question a lot.
           First, when I informed family and friends back home in Chicago that I'd be moving to "the 'Lou" (serious question: you guys actually call it that? Also is it St. Louisians or St. Lunatics?)
           But mostly after I moved here.. by people born and raised here! LOL
           "Why?" "No, but really why?", were often part of my first conversations here.
           But to answer the question very long story short, one of my older sisters had to move here for a job and asked if I would like to come too.
           I guess not really a long story or even all that interesting.
           But it does bring us to March 2019... the next chapter!

       <h2>We Have Two Days to Find an Apartment!</h2>
       <p>
           I had actually never been to Saint Louis!
           I of course knew of it's exsistence and incomplete McDonald's sign, but didn't think of it much, perks of being a Sox fan!
           So back on track, big sis has job offer in hand, and then she's told she has to do a month of training in Minnesota and then be in STL three days after.
           Not a lot of wiggle room to pack two apartments and find one in a new city!
           But we did it and you can too, here's how:
           <li>
               Step 1: Rope oldest sister into impromptu weekend roadtrip! (Optional)
           </li>
           <li>
               Step 2: Find a ton of apartment listings and wittle it down to those who.. uh well respond! With that timeline, you can't be picky!
           </li>
           <li>
               Step 3: Most important step, stop at a Casey's to get gas station donuts on your drive down.
            </li>
            <li>
                Step 4: Visit 5 apartments in 12 hours, drive around, eat at Pappy's Smokehouse. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Step 5: Make the smartest decision since you've started this journey, choose the apartment that's walking distance from Pappy's!
            </li>
            <li>
                Step 6: Drive back to Chicago, break up with your boyfriend of almost a year, and pack your stuff! 
            </li>
            BOOM, you did it! You're moving to St. Louis, baby!

       <h3>Welcome to Locust Street</h3>
       <p>
           So I'm here. 
           Find that I like St. Louis a lot. Imo's is not good pizza. But toasted ravioli is great, really good barbeque.
           Everyone drives like its Sunday afternoon no matter the time or day, but not the biggest deal.
           I start work at an ice cream shop, great ice cream, awesome coworkers. Start making friend, getting into a routine..
           And just when I'm really getting into my groove, MY SISTER GETS A JOB BACK IN CHICAGO!

       <h4>"So Why Are You Still Here?"</h4>
       <p>
           Well that's the classic story of Girl meets Boy, Boy brings Girl lots of Sugarfire, Girl's arteries won't let her leave.
           Now to get cheesy (which is a pun, because he brought a lot of brisket cheesesteaks home) some people say love sneaks up on you when you least expect and you're not looking for it, but when you know, ya just know!
           Never really belived in that junk but then I met the love of my life and I just knew in my gut this was it!
           And to my shock (and probably a lot of other people) we're still going strong! Despite the rom- com start, I was totally right and now we have a teething terrorist (I do love her) that is almost walking!

       <h5>Just Gonna Wrap This Up..</h5>
       <p>
           Yes, my sister abandoned me in Saint Louis.
           But to be fair she did tell me about Coder Girl so she's not all bad.
